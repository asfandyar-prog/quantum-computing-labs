# Introduction to Quantum Computing Labs — University of Debrecen

This repository contains hands-on lab materials for the **Introduction to Quantum Computing Elective Course** at the University of Debrecen, developed and instructed by **Asfand Yar** (Computer Science, Year 1). These labs are designed to provide students with both theoretical foundations and practical experience using **Qiskit** — IBM’s open-source SDK for quantum computation.

## 📘 Course Overview

The course is structured as a two-part series per week:
- **Theory Session (1 hour)**: Covers the mathematical and conceptual foundations.
- **Lab Session (1 hour)**: Reinforces theory through practical Qiskit-based implementations.

## 📁 Repository Structure


Each lab includes:
- Annotated Qiskit code
- Circuit visualizations
- Inline explanations
- Plots (Bloch sphere, histograms)
- Concept checks and outputs

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- `Python 3.10`
- `Qiskit 0.45.0 (Terra, Aer)`
- `Jupyter Notebook`
- `Matplotlib, Seaborn`
- `Miniconda (sami-env)`

> IBM Quantum Cloud is **not required**; all labs are simulated locally using `qiskit-aer`.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Construct and simulate quantum circuits
- Understand core concepts: qubits, gates, superposition, entanglement
- Visualize quantum states and measurement results
- Implement quantum algorithms like teleportation and superdense coding
- Develop a foundational understanding of hybrid quantum-classical computing
